                    Vibrations are oscillations of a mechanical or structural system about an equilibrium position.
                    Vibrations are initiated when an inertia element is displaced from its equilibrium
                    position due to an energy imparted to the system through an external source.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A restoring force, or a conservative force developed in a potential energy element, pulls the element
                    back toward equilibrium. When work is done on the block to displace it from its equilibrium 
                    position, potential energy is developed in the spring.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the block is released the spring force pulls the block toward equilibrium with the potential energy
                    being converted to kinetic energy. In the absence of non-conservative forces, this transfer
                    of energy is continual, causing the block to oscillate about its equilibrium position.
